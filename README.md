# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 // the below code is going to bind whatever input variable with this input field and onChange event handler will store any charecters that are typed in and will set the value of the input state variable in setIput eg: if we type "read me" the value for input will be "read me" 
    return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <input 
      type= "text"
      value={input}
      onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} /> 

 const deleteTodo = (id) => {
      //filter todo with the id
      const newList = list.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id); //list.filter will check each todo and if todo id is not equal to the id of the todo we want to remove it will add that todo to this newlist 
      setList(newList);
    };

    // This is the functioon for adding todo's it will take in the (todo) and then create a variable called newTodo which is a jsoon object. This new todo will have an id which used to identify the todo. The id will be just a randon numbers 
    const addTodo = (todo) => {
      const newTodo = {
        id: Math.random(),
        todo: todo,};

      setList([...list, newTodo]);
      setInput("");
    };

setList([...list, newTodo]); this will add todo to the list
setInput(""); this will use to clear the input box
